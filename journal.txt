# Introduction - How it all began #

Insert monologue here.

Pauli talks about quantum mechanics, plagiarising from me in reference 1.

That thief Dirac also stole my ideas.

# Why I am so brilliant #
I came up with all this quantum stuff first.

# Methodology #
I read a bunch of textbooks about history, for example (A Brief History of Time,
Hawking)

# Results #
I have been the victim of a great injustice. History will not look kindly on Dirac and Pauli.

# Conclusions #
A groundbreaking historical analysis has shown that my claims are
vindicated. But there is more work to be done. Gibe mone plox.
